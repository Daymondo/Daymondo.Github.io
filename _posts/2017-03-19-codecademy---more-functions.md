    <td>We did codecademy this lesson, I was still stuck on the same task as last week. I manage to overcome this task by getting help from the Q and A forums, I got help by reading how the people did the code and working on that. Then from there I continued to progress through some of the less difficult tasks, with my usual methods.  </td>

    <td>My learning is limited as I don't remember how to do the tasks. To solve this issue I could do more codecademy at home in my spare time so I can remember how to do the code so I can complete the tasks quicker.</td>
