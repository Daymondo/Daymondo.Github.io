**Blog review **

To find ways to improve our blog e.g make the posts easier to read.

**Lesson review **

This lesson we were reviewing are blogs the majority including mine were not amazing, and so most need improvement, if not all. There were not particularly many good things done so i'm going to move on.

My blog like most other was not amazing the reading quality was not great, so hopefully this blog is an improvement. To improve most had to make things more visible, have a better writing layout. Those were the main points of improvement for the whole class.

Now I hope that the people reading this find it as an improvement so that it is easier to read it. And hopefully the blogs to come will be of the improved quality that they hopefully are now.
