    <td>This lesson as usual we went on codecademy and did the tasks. However I had been getting the code wrong as I didn't read the text properly. So I learnt through the help of Mr Keen telling me what I had done wrong and helping me correct it. </td>

    <td>For the last 3 tasks I had done the the whole thing wrong, this was because I missed out on one important detail so in the end it didn't work although it worked in earlier stages. I had to get help to solve this problem. I need to read the text and not miss out any details that will hinder me in the future.</td>
