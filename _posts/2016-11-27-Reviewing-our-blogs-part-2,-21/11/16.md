**Reviewing our blogs again! **

This lesson we reviewed some of our blogs and then went on to do some coding.

 

**Lesson review **

This lesson we started off by looking at some of the blogs, good job my teacher did not look at my because at this point it was completely dysfunctional. However one of the people who were good at It helped me out so it is working now. In the coding part of the lesson we didn't make much progress as we spent a lot of the time on our blogs.

This lesson certainly helped me to make progress on how my blog looks and hopefully it's appealing to those who view it. However I will try to make even more progress on it to make it look its best.

Next time I think I and my partner need to be slightly quicker and efficient typing in the code. But we are making progress even though it may be slow.
