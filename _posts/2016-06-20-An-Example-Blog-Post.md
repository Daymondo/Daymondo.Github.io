An Example Blog Post

What went well?

Today I successfully typed in my username and password at the 3rd attempt, which is an improvement. While we were having a whole class discussion, I thought really hard about my questions and answers before I spoke.

What was not so good? 

I talked too much with my partner about things other than work so fell behind. I didn't listen to the instructions properly and wasted time. 

How to Improve? 

I will listen more carefully to the instructions and make some notes. 

I will try to concentrate without talking about silly things with my friends.

I will try to make connections between what I already know and can do, with the new work.
