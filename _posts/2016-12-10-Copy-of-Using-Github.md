    <td>This lesson we started off by getting out all the equipment: Mouse, power cable, monitor, booklet and the fuze box. During typing up the code we swapped roles: typing and reading out the words. If at any point we got stuck we would read back on the code to check for slight errors.</td>

    <td>In the lesson there were multiple set back. Firstly my typing was not the best and I kept on making mistakes which took up time to correct. As well as that There were other people at stages ahead of us who were using the robot arm. Sometimes things went wrong with their coding and it made a loud distracting sound. This put us off our work and it took time to regain focus. </td>
