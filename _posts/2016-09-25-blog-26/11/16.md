**understanding the basics**

Start of coding book I need to learn the basics of coding which I achieved

**Lesson review**

Me and my friend/faithful assistant Josh managed to find out how to make a word show again and again and againâ€¦ you get the idea. We made it so you have to wait one second every time a word pops up we also managed to change the colours of the word and background on the fuze.

I think me and Josh could have worked faster and maybe to concentrate on other people's work less as I think it put us off every time someone else did something that was more advanced than we were.

I will let Josh do the majority of the typing as I'm quite slow and tend to spell things wrong, in the first lesson I kept on typing word instead of world (pretty dodgy). I think we could spend more time reading what to do to understand it more.
