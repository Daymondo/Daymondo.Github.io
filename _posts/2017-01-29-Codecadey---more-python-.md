    <td>For the majority of this lesson we were on codecademy. Only getting stuck when typing things in wrong, then unstucking ourselves. I learnt how strings worked and how I can use date and time correctly. Also mid lesson we had a talk on cheating and how we are doing but not realising that. In today's lesson this form of cheating happened. In this type of cheating someone ask for help and is given the answer without trying that hard to get the problem solved. Itâ€™s like having someone point out the answers in a test for you. This is bad because when it does come up in a test you won't know what to do and won't have your friend to help you.</td>
