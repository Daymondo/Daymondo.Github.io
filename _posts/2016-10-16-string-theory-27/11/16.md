    <td> When we got the computer sorted and went on the zoom of the computer was too much for me and my partner and so a respectable portion of the lesson was taken up trying to fix it, this caused a lot of distraction while doing our work. As well as distracting others to get our problem solved. That is why my partner and I need to be more efficient when working.</td>
