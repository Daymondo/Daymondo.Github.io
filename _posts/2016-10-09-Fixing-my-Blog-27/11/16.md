    <td> In this week's lesson rather than coding we were focusing on fixing our blogs, as many people were having issues with there's. So we were told by Mr Keen how to fix them in vigourous detail so it was quite difficult to get it wrong. I had to delete my blog many times before it started working.   </td>

    <td> What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?:</td>

  <tr>
    <td> Being told how to fix our blogs took quite a long time so I was not able to fix mine during the lesson. However I finished it at home. So I need to be quicker and maybe get more things done during the lesson. </td>

    <td> I need to ask more questions in lessons to sort out my problems that I have but to try and find a solution to my problem before asking. I need to focus on the task I am doing and I must try to correct my mistakes by looking over at what I have done.</td>
