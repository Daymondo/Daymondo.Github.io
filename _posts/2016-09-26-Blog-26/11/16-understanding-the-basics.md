**understanding the basics**

25/09/16

I started at the beginning of the book and managed to complete one section.

  

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

 

Me and my friend/faithful assistant Josh managed to find out how to make a word show again and again and againâ€¦ you get the idea. We made it so you have to wait one second every time

a word pops up we also managed to change the colours of the word and background on the fuze.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 

I think me and Josh could have worked faster and maybe to concentrate on other people's work less as I think it put us off every time someone else did something that was more advanced than we were.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I will let Josh do the majority of the typing as I'm quite slow and tend to spell things wrong, in the first lesson I kept on typing word instead of world (pretty dodgy). I think we could spend more time reading what to do to understand it more.
