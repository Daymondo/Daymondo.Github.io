    <td> I and my partner did the usual routine of doing one piece of code, one typing one reading then swapping every piece of code or so. We used this method however we did not manage to complete the section as the bits of code were quite large and complicated. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Because the code was long the person who says what to type got bored so I and my partner were rather slow at saying what to type as we got distracted by other people as there was not much going on our computer.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time I will try not to get distracted and be more focused on the task that I am doing. Also  I will try and make what i'm doing more exciting for me and my partner</td>
